# python_api_challenge

##### Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"
##### Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

#### Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude to fulfill the first requirement, you'll use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code. Next, you'll create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
##### Latitude vs. Temperature
##### Latitude vs. Humidity
##### Latitude vs. Cloudiness
##### Latitude vs. Wind Speed

#### Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship to fulfill the second requirement, compute the linear regression for each relationship. Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude). You may find it helpful to define a function in order to create the linear regression plots.
##### Next, create a series of scatter plots. Be sure to include the linear regression line, the model's formula, and the r values.
##### You should create the following plots:
##### Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
##### Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
##### Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
##### Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
##### Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
##### Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
##### Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
##### Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

#### Part 2: VacationPy
##### In this deliverable, you'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
##### The code needed to import the required libraries and load the CSV file with the weather and coordinates data for each city created in Part 1 is provided to help you get started.
